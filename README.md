# Attendance
System for maintaining a database of employee arrival and leaving times in multiple work settings.

The system uses remote boxes that respond to fingerprints or tags to identify the employee. That remote box must be connected to wifi, and it makes a web request to a central server that logs the check-in/check-out times.
The central server is managed via a web interface.
Any number of remote boxes can be added and all will access the same central server.
